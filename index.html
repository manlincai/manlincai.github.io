<p>


Welcome! My name is Manlin Cai. I am a PhD Candidate in <a href="https://sociology.ubc.ca/">the Department of Sociology</a> at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">the University of British Columbia</a>. I expect to graduate in early 2026 and am actively exploring opportunities for the next chapter of research, teaching, and collaboration.

My research interests include migration and immigration, race and ethnicity, gender, and work-family connections. One line of my reseach focuses on how race and ethnicity shape immigrant integration in Canada. Specifically, I examine how racial minority immigrants choose romantic partners, navigate educational and employment opportunities, and secure permanent residency. Another line investigates gender inequalities at the work-family interface in both Canada and China. Leveraging both quantitative and qualitative expertise, I analyze large-scale nationally representative datasets alongside in-depth interviews.

I received my M.A. in Social Sciences (Sociology) from <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/">the University of Chicago</a> in 2019 and my B.A. in Economics from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a> in 2018.
