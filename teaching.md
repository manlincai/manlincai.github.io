I have accumulated over four years of teaching and mentoring experience through extensive teaching assistantships, guest lectures, and research mentorship. 

I served as a teaching assistant for the following courses at the University of British Columbia:
- Social Statistics (Twice)
  - Independently taught  recitation sessions
- Social Interaction and Culture (Introduction to Sociology course)
  - Independently taught an hour-long tutorial for two sections per week
- Inequality and Social Change (Introduction to Sociology course)
  - Independently taught an hour-long tutorial for two sections per week
- Work and Inequality
- Survey Methods
- Family Context of Human Development 

Below is some feedback from my students:

- A student remarked on my Social Statistics recitation: "Manlin’s recitation sessions were very helpful, and she did an amazing job explaining difficult statistical concepts!”
  
- Students highlighted that my tutorials “created fun and engaging assignments and discussions,” “\[were their] favourite discussion class ever,” and “helped \[them] understand how to apply what \[they] learned to real life.”

- They also spoke highly of the inclusive learning environment in my tutorials: 
  - “During group discussions everyone contributed, and when we came together as a class, everyone felt open to sharing their group’s ideas.”
  - “She [Manlin] made the environment comfortable where we felt we could openly share our thoughts.”
